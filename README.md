# Summary
I want to build a habit of writing code each day. I will place that code (or a description of code I wrote elsewhere) in this repository for habit tracking :pencil:

# Notes
If a file is in `.md` or `.txt` then it is describing text I wrote elsewhere (Godot, at work and its proprietary, etc...)
