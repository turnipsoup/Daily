I did two things today

1. At work I wrote a script to let us know when the most recent JP INPC files were available from a Japan post website.

2. I published my average color palette generator program here: [https://github.com/LetsEatLabs/ColorAveragePaletteGenerator](https://github.com/LetsEatLabs/ColorAveragePaletteGenerator)
